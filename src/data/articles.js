    content: `
Safe packaging is your first line of defense against transit damage. Start with a **new, sturdy, corrugated box**—preferably double-wall for heavy or fragile items—and ensure all flaps are intact. Wrap each item individually with **at least 2 inches of cushioning** using bubble wrap or foam sheets, and fill all gaps with packing peanuts or crumpled paper.

### Step-by-Step Packing Checklist
- Inspect the box for damage and tape the base with reinforced packing tape  
- Wrap fragile items individually with bubble wrap or foam wrap  
- Fill all hollow spaces completely with cushioning  
- Test — shake gently to ensure no movement  
- Seal securely and label clearly with “Fragile” or “Handle With Care”  

**Pro Tip:** Don’t rely solely on labels—well-structured packaging is more important than warning stickers.

    excerpt:
      "Shipping insurance reduces your risk when sending valuable or fragile items. Here’s how to choose the right coverage.",
    content: `
Shipping insurance reduces the financial risk of lost or damaged packages. There are three main types of coverage:

- **Declared Value Coverage** – Based on the value you declare at shipment  
- **All-Risk Coverage** – Protects against most damage or loss types  
- **Named Perils Coverage** – Covers only specific risks listed in the policy  

Courier-provided insurance is convenient but can have coverage limits. Third-party insurance may offer broader protection, especially for high-value items.

**Pro Tip:** Always read the fine print—some items like electronics, glass, or perishables may be excluded from coverage.
